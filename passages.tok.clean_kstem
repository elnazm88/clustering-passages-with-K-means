2020338_0	a small group of politician believe strong that the fact that saddam hussien remain in power after the first gulf war was a signal of weakness to the rest of the world one that invite attack and terrorism shortly after taking power with george bush in 2000 and after the attack on 9 11 they were able to use the terrorist attack to justify war with iraq on this basis and exaggerate threat of the development of weapon of mass destruction the military strength of the u s and the brutality of saddam s regime led them to imagine that the military and politics victory would be relatively easy
2020338_1	because there is a lot of oil in iraq
2020338_2	it is tempt to say that the us invade iraq because it has lot of oil but the us is not a country in a deep economic problem that capture other country ’ s oil is an actual need for survival it is more likely that the iraq invade kuwait scenario would fall under that assumption i think that the us government has come to a conclusion that we are on the verge of a war of religion or more likely ideology it would be presumptuous to try and deter a one cause to the coming war i think that the world wide spread of the media with its many form cable satellite internet etc have pushed the moslem regime to the extreme fear that secular and democratic influence is penetrating their country and will result in an up raise against them one of the best way to maintain the power that you have and even gain more of it is by hatred when the common man is occupy hate an outside enemy its hatred is kept out side the county and would not be direct towards the regime so i believe that the us understand that the fanatic moslem regime have already start a war on the democratic world and now is the time to try a fight it so why invade iraq because it is a huge week moslem country that thought to be easy to defeat this is exactly the same reason why afghanistan was first and syria is next in line
2020338_3	i think yuval is pretty spot on it s a prove ground and a focal point for terror activity that s not on america soil and because no one like saddam hussein no other country even in the middle east were about to rise up and join his side rabid speculation now the pentagon has a model that say it take 5 years 200b and 2 000 casualty to rebuild a dictatorship into a democracy who s next on the list
2874684_0	call an area apiarist they should be able to help you and would most likely remove them at no charge in exchange for the hive the bee have value and they now belong to you
2874684_1	do n t try this yourself but this is what the old fashion way is done in some village in other parts of the world the guy who dismantle wear a mask with hole at the eyes so he can see carry a big sack with burning coal in it he also wrap his hand with thick cloth carry an empty bag to collect the honey in it he then collect the honey in the empty bag pull the hive into the bag of coal if he just wants to collect the honey he would leave after collect the honey but the bag of coal is use to choke burn the bee if he want to get rid of the hive that s a bit like code in cobol assembly
4193114_0	there s a general belief in europe and in fact elsewhere in the world such as china that it s unhealthy to drink water with a meal because it dilute the digestive juice wine is ok because it stimulate digestion and mineral waters are also considered digestive in general europe are much more concerned with the digestive process than america
4193114_1	i d like to take a different approach in answer this i think geography location and higher available of other drink probably is a big reason that water is not consume as much by people in certain regions including europe i believe and many visitor have comment that children drink less water and more soda in usa this is primarily due to the fact that soda company advertise a lot making it more attractive second soda is attractive and according to a few medical expert it s even addictive yes caffeine is addictive to some extent second the cold weather in upper northern hemisphere in general is more of a reason that ppl drink less water and more of other drink for example if you are from a tropical country or from a very humid place you would probably naturally be drink more water rather than if you are from a country like austria switzerland denmark finland another reason is that people being less immune to impure water like tap water and being more dependent on bottle water make the water less afford and less available if you need to pay extra or need to work hard to get the commodity you may resort to cheap commodity or a near by commodity another reason i also feel is the commute use car rather than walking or cycle if you walk more to commute like walk to train station walk a few block to get groceries etc then you are more likely to drink water when compare to driving to every place you go and exert yourself much less in many other country people walk walk and walk for several small things lack of education and aware is also a reason for not consume enough water not many people except for few educated one know that 80 of our body is water even if they knew ppl forget that fact easily and resort to other drink there are simply several reason or combination of reason for not consume enough water by the people in general finally after have said all this beer happen
1908421_0	hybrid car save energy in two ways 1 by store energy from the breaks2 by engaging the gas motor only in it s most effective work rpm meaning that the system will engage the gas motor mostly at coursing speed close to the most efficient motor rpm have said the above driving in the city almost never get you to the efficient rpm also it is true that the same energy that is being store in the car battery need to be generate by chemical energy the cool thing about it is that the pollution can be outside of the city and not in the city like in san francisco the electric bus generate the same pollution as a gas bus it is just not in the city you can also add that electric engine are much quiet then gas engine so all in all i the hybrid benefit are more visible in city driving
1908421_1	the gas mileage for some hybrid is better in the city because they spend more time use their electric motor instead of their gas engine most hybrid have battery pack which are charged by what is call generative break instead of slow down with traditional brake these car store some of the energy from brake into a battery pack then when the light change and the car move again the energy store in the battery can be use to move the car or assist the engine in moving the car in the city this effect can be more pronounced because of more frequent stopping and start
1908421_2	there are the two reason mention already use the energy from the break and use the gas engine only when it can work efficient one more thing to note is that for several car the hybrid model of a car has a small gas engine than the regular model e g for honda civic the gas engine for the hybrid model is 1 3l which is not available in the regular model so even without the other things this engine will get better gas mileage than the large engine
3608897_0	in general it means that in a very high speed also apply for low speed but hard to measure a mass turn into energy and vise versa the conversion rate is c2 c square
3608897_1	i think an expansion on the answer from the previous person may be in order e mc 2 or energy equal mass times the speed of light square was einstein s breakthrough theory on the relationship between energy and matter it show that matter is indeed contained energy and allow that energy to be calculate this relationship was critical to the development of atomic energy as it allow physicist to determine the amount of energy that would be release because they could calculate the energy of the atom from its mass and compare it to the energy of its parts proton neutron electron by their masses the difference was the energy contained in the binding of the parts which as we know now is huge
2175566_0	i use to work in a college admission office for a major university and they use a specific formula for calculating gpa they did this to put everyone on an even play field so that high school that do n t weight ap class different would be measured the same as those that do though i do n t remember the specific calculation anymore i definitely remember that ap class were given a higher score i d suggest you take the ap class and try for the best grade you can get because ultimately it ll be weighted higher at the college university you are interested in give you a better chance of get in
2175566_1	most college look at gpa and class rank also most high school multiply earn ap gpa by a multiply to reflect additional difficulty for instance a b in an ap class in my school was a 3 96 vs a 4 0 for an a in a standard class in that case the ap class is probably better i d like to think that more selective college take a more holistic approach to admission though i have no evidence of this as i got a budget price state school education and a darn good one at that

1528314_0	i suggest go back to your computer for fps console control are not well suit to fps style gameplay the only console that will truly be able to pull this off well is the nintendo revolution which will come out next year
1528314_1	i have to disagree with the previous answer i think it really come down to what you re most familiar with personally i never really got into pc game as heavy as i did console game as such i find a controller much more natural than a keyboard and mouse much as i d expect a pc game to find a controller awkward and clumsy the keyboard and mouse have many a lot of advantage and if you pit a controller player against a keyboard and mouse player the controller player would be at a distinct disadvantage all in all though console maker and game developer have done a fantastic job of mapping fps control to hand held controller it just take practice that and you may want to consider adjust the look sensitivity for your controller but i would n t worry too much with the usb port on the new console that have hit xbox 360 or will be hit ps3 the market you can expect to see some keyboard and mice coming out to appeal to pc game as for the nintendo revolution s controller i m skeptical of how well it will work in practice it s a great concept but i think it will prove difficult to execute successful enough not to become a niche feature that couple with nintendo s limited fps library and lack of support from some of the industry s leading fps developer do n t give me an optimistic picture of the revolution being the place to be in terms of get an fps fix

4070764_0	since 533 the new pope has also decided on the name by which he is to be call at this time pope john ii was the first to adopt a new papal name he felt that his original name mercuriu was inappropriate as it was also the name of a roman god in most case even if such consideration are absent pope tend to choose new papal name the last pope to reign under his baptism name was pope marcellu ii 1555
4070764_1	in the bible a new name show a new turn in one s life vocation for example god rename abram to abraham and jesus rename simon to peter both demonstrate that their old ways are left behind and they are embark upon a new journey likewise when a man is elect pope he take on a role that transcend his own humble past he become a figure that is greater than who he was before sure pope benedict xvi can remain cardinal ratzinger but the pope is more than that person ever was and he represent more than just himself taking a new name has a long tradition within the catholic church and even today many individual will take confirmation name for that same reason of denote a new life vocation
1535629_0	they go into elementary education because they like kid partly it is because there are more elementary kindergarten teacher employ in school than any other type of teacher so the job market is large
1535629_1	presumable because the subject matter is easy and the kid while not always perfect are less defiant than teenager who often do n t engender the same amount of sympathy as well as a desire in other to teach them and because teacher are often comprise of person with idealist notions of helping people and early childhood is the best time to begin that
1535629_2	the answer is fairly simple as the educational system shift from elementary to middle to high school there is a shift towards a more subject orient focus those teaching high school for instance are mostly train in the subject area that they teach i e mathematics science etc it is my belief that many who teach at the high school level do not initially intend to be teacher but to be professional in their chosen field the learning to teach is secondary to knowing the specific subject matter elementary teacher on the other hand are those who know go into college that they want to teach they are for the most part female nurture individual who want to work with children the subject matter of elementary education is teaching methodology much of the curriculum is rudimentary for instance add three digit numbers is not complicated however the teaching of it to young children is the art really the only other area of training focus on teaching is special education those major in elementary education or special education do well by gain degree in each
1535629_3	many elementary education student including myslef go into elementary education to get their feet wet once you get your degree in elementary education you can try out teaching with younger student who are generally easy to manage this is especially the case of younger teacher who may be intimidate by highschooler who are only five or six years younger in age after gain some experience in education it is easy to find your niche and what grade suite you also for some teacher i think it is a matter of wanting to work with kid while they are still cute kind of like people who fall in love with puppy but do n t care for full size dogs
1535629_4	well the subject matter is not eaiser but often more interesting elementary education major can teach a wide age range of student eaiser is relative to who is taking the course i math major may have a very hard time with an elementary education reading course there are many reason
4164685_0	some of the obvious benefit are expense but some are for example you can get a not so use vehicle for alot cheap than you would a new one cause who ever bought it new has already to the hit on depreciate and you can benefit from this the best example of this is a use toyota new its price is signicant higher than a use one of the same model year with less than 10 000 mile cause they do not hold their value as well as they did once before my suggestion stick with japan engine honda toyota subaru nissan in that order i hope this help if you have any more question feel free chrystal luvscar yahoo
4164685_1	on average new car lose 40 of their value in the first 2 years it is a very good idea to buy a use car if you bought a reliable 2 year old use car with 30 000 mile you would expect to get at least another 60 000 to 80 000 more mile out of it that is assume you buy a quality car like a honda or toyota car are a no win situation financially but at least you ll spend less money over time if you stick with use car good luck
4164685_2	i think cheap is about your only advantage and sometimes that s not an advantage at all
4164685_3	it s cheap
4164685_4	its cheap that s really all but if you re go to finance it i would highly recommend finance it for 3 years otherwise if you finance it for 5 years like you would a new car by the time you re done pay it off you ll have a car that is 7 or 8 years old or more depend on what year it is it s not a bad idea buy a car that is 2 years old bc most car deppreciate the most in the first 3 years so you re basically letting someone else make the payment for the first 2 years the payment will be the same but you ll only have to make payment for 3 years sorry that was a little long wind

3228020_3	this is an extremely serious condition for a cat the result of not treat it swift can be deaf for the cat i got my cat from a friend of a friend who own a farm she was born there and probably spent a lot of time in the barn and outdoors in general when i got her she had this black gunk in both her ear i took her to the vet almost as soon as i got her so i could get her shot and get her register checked out and her checked out and find out anything i should know as a cat owner she was the first cat i had ever own he said the black stuff was ear mite and gave me some stuff for that i dutiful put that on her on my back patio in the mornings according to the directions that came with it the result was her ear got clean and stay that way forever she suffer no loss of hearing as far as i can tell she come when i call her name just like a dog in fact my mom had a cat which she got from a shelter eventually it pass on to my brother before it had been an indoor cat my brother decided it should be an outdoor cat at some point the cat must have gotten ear mite not sure if this was before anyone in our family had it or afterwards whichever it was the mite infest must not have been caught and treat in time the cat is quite deaf it never respond when being call even to look when you are right there in the room with it it do not respond to loud noise at all either i know the annual checkup you take your cat to the vet for are kind of expensive but a big portion of that is for the shot some of which they do not need every year anyway for example my cat get a 3 year rabies shot so it do not need one every year so most years the annual visit to vet is not as expensive as that one if you are sure that the condition is cause by ear mite and you can not afford to take the cat to the vet right now at least get the medicine right away and apply it as direct i just look and petsmart carry it there is probably a petsmart near you and if not it looks like you can order it from their web site it only costs 10 49 today according to the second source i have list kittencare com the mite could have move from your cat to your house it sound like they might move back again you might want to be on guard for that i really encourage you to talk to a vet like i said though both my cat and my brother s mother s cat had the same condition my cat has perfect hearing and the other cat is completely deaf the only difference was in the treatment they received if you must skip the visit to the vet or delay it do not delay treat the ear mite at all get the medicine for it and careful use it as direct make sure you apply the miticide outside and make sure you dispose of whatever you apply it to your cat ear with outside as well do not bring it back in your house to throw it away do not wipe your cat ear inside you might wipe the mite onto your floor and you really want to keep them outside i am including a couple more links just so you will have more source of information at your fingertip might as well do all your research at once so you can act right away without second thought or wish you had more information good luck with the treatment and i hope your kitty get well the first step is spot the mite and recognize what they are not just thinking it is dirt you have done that so now all that is left is the treatment and it is not hard to do make sure you hold your cat s head perfectly still while you apply the stuff do not go in too far either she should be fine if you have caught the problem in time
3228020_4	you could start with a simple ear clean use warm olive cooking oil keep in ear rub ear a few minutes then allow your cat to shake it out into a tissue try not to push stuff back into ear tresaderm is the safest mite killing stuff to use is you have n t had a vet look to see if the eardrum is damage yet it also has antibiotic and anti inflammatory in it ask other pet owner to find someone who has some you could use ear mite are infectious and can travel best to treat soon

932631_1	velocity distort time the fast you go the slow time go for you this effect is negligable unless you are go very close to the speed of light in fact the formula is t t sqrt 1 v 2 c 2 where t is the time that has pass from a stationary observer t is the time that has pass for you sqrt means square root and 2 means square as you can notice when v is small since c 2 is so huge you get a miniscule decimal and 1 minus that number is basically as small as 1 0000000000001 or something and so time is not really affected as v get large it can never be the speed of light then the denomonator would be zero that fraction become close to 1 so when you subtract it from one the denomonator get small and small meaning t get small in order for t to remain constant this means that time slow down for the object moving at such velocity this formula is correct it is part of einstein s theory of relativity and i have had to derive it myself from ordinary mechanics formula according to the same factor length also contract it has been observe in certain tiny particle coming to the earth s surface these particle have a certain lifespan before they become unstable and decay they are also moving at a certain speed which is very fast close to the speed of light you should simply be able to calculate v d t velocity distance time to find out how far they would travel however they somehow travel farther than that when this calculate distance is put into that formula we come up with the correct distance they actually travel

3320375_1	you can go against the grain and you get less skin irritation imo you get a close shave with a good electric shaver because of these reason i use to shave with a gilette m3 power in the shower and just switch to a braun electric shaver i never thought you could get as close as shaving in the shower but i was wrong the electric one really have improve a lot in the past couple years i test them a few years ago and was n t convinced i do n t think i ll go back to a regular blade ever again

2476370_0	one of the basic features of language is that it change over time as people speak it america that came from england spoke like englishmen of their particular class but then they became isolated from england and both group of people had their language evolve but in different directions similarly france italy spain portugal and romania were all originally latin and the accent and dialect became total different language mass communication like television and movies probably slow this process down a great deal
2476370_1	it s due to the way their vocal chord have set up have spoken their native language for so long their vocal chord are best suit to their own native language nothing to do with adaptation at all if we brought a switzerland man over here in the u s at birth and raise him in the south he would speak perfect southern english because of his use of the english laungage but if we took him back to switzerland and taught him germany it would then be impossible for him to speak perfect germany his vocal chord would be set up for speak southern us english
2476370_2	i guess because everyone has a different intonation in their native tongue even if the english is perfectly good gramatic it still wo n t sound america to most
